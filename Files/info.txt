HOW TO INSTALL THE SIMULATOR.

Steps to install (all the commands must be done on terminal):
	- Run ./install.sh <pathname> 
	- Open <pathname>
	- Run ./run.sh
Inside of the 'sources' folder there are all the folders with s-
cripts inside of them. Inside of each 'scriptname' folder there
are some files .txt to explain the tasks of the script.
If you don't know how the scripts work, you can see all the .txt
files showed one by one. Use the command:
	- Run ./help.sh
	
INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE SIMULATOR.

Welcome to the ML99 simulator of an hoist robot. The robot is a 
double axis robot, x and z. The simulator has two different con-
soles where the user can use different commands.
The two consoles are:
1. Command Console.
2. Inspection Console.
Both of them have different commands and buttons to make the si-
mulator work inside the enviroment.
First we talk about the Command Consoles keys:
	- ↑ (up arrow) makes the z axis increase.
	- ↓ (down arrow) makes the z axis decrease.
	- → (right arrow) makes the x axis increase.
	- ← (left arrow) makes the x axis decrease.
	- x (x letter NOT CAPITAL!) makes the x axis movement stop.
	- z (z letter NOT CAPITAL!) makes the z axis movement stop.
Be careful! These commands can ONLY be used in command console.
Now we talk about the Inspection Console keys:
	- s (x letter NOT CAPITAL!) makes the all the system stops.
	- r (r letter NOT CAPITAL!) makes the system reset by retur-
	ning the value of x and z axis to 0. No other commands exce-
	pt 's' can be used while the system is resetting.
All the informations of your use and all the commands you press-
ed are stored inside the 'logfile' folder inside the 'sources' 
folder. Remember that everytime you run the program this file w-
ill be reset.
