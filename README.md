# ARP Assignment 1
This is a simple hoist robot simulator coded in C, it was created by Luca Predieri and Matteo Carlone for the first assignment of Advanced Robotics Programming class in the master degree ROBOTICS ENGINEERING program in Unige at Genova, Italy.
## Running the program.
As compiler we use the classic gcc. Inside the shell file there are all the compiling instructions, so you only have to run:
```bash
$ ./run.sh
```
Obviously you have to be inside the repo of the project.
